A GCode to GCode converter designed to generate datastrips for a fully 3D Printed 3D Printer

This program takes a pre-sliced GCode file of a 3D model and converts it to a printable GCode file containing the data strip that encodes the original model in a custom data strip language. This program is designed to work with 37 channel controllers (7x3,4X4).
